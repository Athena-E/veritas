# Cargo configuration for veritas
#
# This configuration uses the system-installed Z3 library instead of
# compiling Z3 from source, which dramatically speeds up build times.
#
# IMPORTANT: You must install Z3 on your system first!
#
# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
#   sudo apt-get install z3 libz3-dev
#
# Linux (Arch):
#   sudo pacman -S z3
#
# macOS:
#   brew install z3
#
# Without Z3 installed, z3-sys will attempt to compile Z3 from source,
# which takes 10-30+ minutes and may cause IDE timeouts/crashes.

[env]
# Use system Z3 library - prevents compiling Z3 from source
# Linux paths (apt/pacman installed)
Z3_SYS_Z3_HEADER = "/usr/include/z3.h"

# Uncomment for macOS (Homebrew):
# Z3_SYS_Z3_HEADER = "/opt/homebrew/include/z3.h"
# Z3_LIBRARY_PATH_OVERRIDE = "/opt/homebrew/lib"

[build]
# Set build jobs to limit parallelism if needed (helps with memory on low-RAM systems)
# jobs = 4
