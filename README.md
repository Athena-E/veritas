# Veritas

A programming language project exploring dependent types, and formal verification. This project aims to develop a toolchain for type-preserving compilation targeting a dependently typed assembly language (DTAL), inspired by [Xi, Harper 2001](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~hamlen/Papers/xi2001dtal.pdf).
